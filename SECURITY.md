## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of this project, we encourage contributors to follow these best practices:

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to patch any known vulnerabilities.
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Never hard-code sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) in the source code. Use environment variables or secure vaults.
3. **Implement Input Validation**: Always validate user input to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
4. **Perform Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews to catch potential security issues before merging changes.
5. **Use Secure Coding Practices**: Familiarize yourself with secure coding practices and OWASP guidelines.
